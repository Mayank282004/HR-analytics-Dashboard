**This project showcases an HR Analytics Dashboard built to analyze employee attrition, demographics, education, job roles, and salary distribution.**

By working on this project, I strengthened my skills in:
  Data Cleaning & Preparation
  Data Visualization (turning raw data into meaningful insights)
  Storytelling with Data (explaining attrition trends clearly)
  Business Problem Solving (helping HR identify key factors of attrition)
